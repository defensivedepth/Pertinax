### **Pertinax**
_Latin: “Persistent, Stubborn”_

The ability to remain active on a target system even after reboots is a key component of a long-term successful compromise. Unfortunately, there are a number of ways for a threat actor to persist in Windows across reboots, and it can be very difficult to comprehensively identify these areas without specialized software. This is where [Sysinternals' Autoruns](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx?f=255&MSPPError=-2147217396) (AR) come into play. Autoruns is a Sysinternals’ tool that has been widely used in the industry to help bring to light the many different areas in Windows used for persistence.

The purpose of Pertinax is succinctly thus:

_To further enhance the host-level capabilities of Security Onion by integrating Sysinternals Autoruns’ logs into the Security Onion ecosystem, and making this data available for OSSEC rulesets as well as ELSA queries._
